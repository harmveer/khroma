    "description": "An implementation of Paul Tol&#39;s colour schemes for use with <code>graphics</code> or <code>ggplot2</code>. These schemes are ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or sequential), with colours that are distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers. This package provides tools to simulate colour-blindness and to test how well the colours of any palette are identifiable. Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.</p>",
