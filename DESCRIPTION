Description: An implementation of Paul Tol's colour schemes for
    use with 'graphics' or 'ggplot2'. These schemes are ready for each
    type of data (qualitative, diverging or sequential), with colours that
    are distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers. This
    package provides tools to simulate colour-blindness and to test how
    well the colours of any palette are identifiable. Several scientific
    thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are
    also implemented.
