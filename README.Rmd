## Overview

Color blindness affects a large number of individuals ^[As many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women with Northern European ancestry have the common form of red-green color blindness.]. When communicating scientific results colour palettes must therefore be carefully chosen to be accessible to all readers.

This R package provides an implementation of Paul Tol's colour schemes ^[Tol, Paul (2018). *Colour Schemes*. SRON. Technical Note No. SRON/EPS/TN/09-002. URL: <https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/data/colourschemes.pdf>.]. These schemes are ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or sequential), with colours that are distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers. This package also provides tools to simulate colour-blindness and to test how well the colours of any palette are identifiable. To simulate colour-blindness in production-ready R figures you may be interested in the [`colorblindr`](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) package.

For specific uses, several scientific thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are implemented. Note that these colour schemes may not be colour-blind safe.

All these colour schemes are implemented for use with base R `graphics` or [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2).

## Installation

Install the released version of `khroma` from CRAN:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("khroma")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nfrerebeau/khroma")
```

## Usage
### Paul Tol's Colour Schemes

Paul Tol offers carefully chosen schemes, ready for each type of data, with colours that are:

* Distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers.
* Distinct from black and white.
* Distinct on screen and paper.
* Matching well together.

All the scales presented in Paul Tol's technical note are implemented here, for use with `graphics` or `ggplot2`. Refer to the original document for details about the recommended uses.

See the vignette for a complete overview:
```{r tol-vignette, eval=FALSE}
utils::vignette("tol")
```

### Scientific colour schemes

The following scientific colour schemes are available:

* International Chronostratigraphic Chart.
* AVHRR Global Land Cover Classification.
* FAO Soil Reference Groups.

More will be added in future releases (suggestions are welcome).

### Diagnostic tools

Test how well the colours are identifiable:

```{r diagnostic, fig.height=2, fig.width=7, fig.align='center'}
# Paul Tol's "bright" colour scheme
# colour() returns a palette function
bright <- colour("bright")

plot_map(bright(7))
```

Simulate colour-blindness (from top to bottom: deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia and achromatopsia):

```{r anomalize, fig.height=2, fig.width=7, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold'}
deuteranopia <- convert(bright, mode = "deuteranopia")
protanopia <- convert(bright, mode = "protanopia")
tritanopia <- convert(bright, mode = "tritanopia")
achromatopsia <- convert(bright, mode = "achromatopsia")

plot_scheme(deuteranopia(7), colours = TRUE)
plot_scheme(protanopia(7), colours = TRUE)
plot_scheme(tritanopia(7), colours = TRUE)
plot_scheme(achromatopsia(7), colours = TRUE)
```
